# front-end app 

Our front-end application, built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, offers a seamless user experience with its two main pages: the Home page and the Data Table page.

On the Home page, users are greeted with an engaging and visually appealing layout. The carefully designed header with a navigation menu ensures easy access to different sections of the application. The hero section captures attention with a captivating welcome message or banner, setting the tone for the rest of the experience. By utilizing React's component-based approach, we've created a dynamic and interactive Home page that delivers a smooth and responsive user interface.
